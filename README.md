## Reasons to use

### Lost with PureCSS

* Bootstrap or Foundation has too much unnecessary classes which won't be needed in this project.

### PostCSS

* Faster compiling process compared to SASS.
* No need to use redundant prefixes in compiled CSS file (saves bandwidth).
* Usage of CSS4 (with cssnext)

### ReactJS

* Greater performance with Virtual DOM over AngularJS
* Possibility to use cleaner HTML sytnax with JSX

### Gulp

* Takes less time to run tasks compared to Grunt.
* Watches specific task and runs only that task. In comparison, Grunt runs entire watch task. 
   
## What's next? (TODO List)

* Implement Flux
* Better service provider for back-end (IoC Containers & Repository Pattern)
* Bootstrap
* CSS Modules
* Minify and GZ
* Front-end automation with npm scripts
* Infinity Loader
* Switch to ES6 (with Babel)
* Upgrade React to latest version
