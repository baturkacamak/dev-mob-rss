## Reasons to use
___

### Lost with PureCSS

* Bootstrap or Foundation has too much unnecessary classes which won't be needed in this project.

### PostCSS

* Faster compiling process compared to SASS.
* No need to use redundant prefixes in compiled CSS file (saves bandwidth).
* Usage of CSS4 (with cssnext)

### ReactJS

* Greater performance with Virtual DOM over AngularJS
* Possibility to use cleaner HTML sytnax with JSX

### Gulp

* Takes less time to run tasks compared to Grunt.
* Watches specific task and runs only that task. In comparison, Grunt runs entire watch task.
